✒️ Fablet — AI-Assisted Writing Platform

Fablet is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack that enables users to write any form of content—stories, research, journals, essays, or long-form text—over time with the help of an AI assistant named Ink.
Fablet is designed for writers who want to create consistently but may not always have the time. Users can write bit by bit, save their progress automatically, and publish their work when ready—while Ink assists as a professional editor and creative companion, not a replacement.

Inkk is an integrated AI agent that enhances the user’s writing experience.

1.Correct spelling and grammar
